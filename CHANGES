== 0.4.5 - 09-Jun-2022
* Support Ruby 3.1 UCRT binary

== 0.4.4 - 18-Mar-2015
* Removed a duplicate hash entry. Thanks go to Baptiste Courtois for the spot.
* Added some specialized test tasks.

== 0.4.3 - 20-Oct-2014
* Updates to the gemspec and Rakefile.

== 0.4.2 - 13-Jul-2012
* Fixed a bug in the way MSVCRT_DLL is set. Thanks go to Park Heesob for
  the spot and patch.
* Some minor test refactoring and cosmetic udpates.

== 0.4.1 - 27-Jan-2012
* Switched Config to RbConfig to silence 1.9 warnings. Thanks go to
  Cameron Cox for the patch.
* Some updates to the README, Rakefile, gemspec and test files.

== 0.4.0 - 18-Oct-2009
* Methods that begin with an underscore, such as _umask(), are now preserved.
  A method alias is also created without an underscore, e.g. umask().
* Added the gem task to the Rakefile.
* Minor updates to the gemspec.

== 0.3.1 - 18-Aug-2009
* Changed license to Artistic 2.0.
* Some gemspec updates, including the addition of a license, an updated
  description and a dependency update.
* One test update for VC++ 9.

== 0.3.0 - 1-Feb-2009
* No longer explicitly checks for an error in the constructor. It lets the
  underlying Win32::API library deal with it.
* More dynamic handling and setting of the MSVCRT_DLL variable.
* Added a WideString implementation. Internal use only.

== 0.2.4 - 18-Jul-2008
* Eliminated unnecessary LoadLibrary() attempts for functions that explicitly
  end with an 'A' or 'W', and all MSVCRT functions, since they have no 'A'
  or 'W' equivalent.
* Replaced all of the attr_reader's with a delegation scheme using Forwardable.
  All Win32::API functions now delegate to the internally stored Win32::API
  object instead of reimplementing them. This change also fixed a bug where
  the effective_function_name method did not work properly.
* Added more tests, and fixed one assertion that was wrong (the prototype).
* Some documentation additions.

== 0.2.3 - 26-Apr-2008
* Improved API.auto_constant and API.auto_method handling for functions that
  start with a lower case character or an underscore.

== 0.2.2 - 17-Apr-2008
* Added the Windows::MSVCRT_DLL constant so that users can specify MSVCRT_DLL
  for the DLL name and it will do the right thing, instead of having to worry
  about specifying a DLL or associated DLL.

== 0.2.1 - 10-Feb-2008
* Added support for long data type names, e.g. 'DWORD' instead of 'L', for
  both the prototype and return type.

== 0.2.0 - 20-Sep-2007
* Now requires the win32-api library.
* Replaced class variables with class instance variables to prevent conflicts.

== 0.1.1 - 25-May-2007
* Fixed a void parameter bug.

== 0.1.0 - 24-May-2007
* Initial release
